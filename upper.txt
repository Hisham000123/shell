FOOTBALL, ALSO KNOWN AS SOCCER, IS THE WORLD’S MOST POPULAR SPORT, PLAYED AND WATCHED BY MILLIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE. IT IS PLAYED BETWEEN TWO TEAMS OF ELEVEN PLAYERS EACH, WITH THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF SCORING GOALS BY GETTING THE BALL INTO THE OPPOSING TEAM’S NET. A STANDARD MATCH LASTS 90 MINUTES, DIVIDED INTO TWO 45-MINUTE HALVES, PLUS ADDITIONAL STOPPAGE TIME.

THE GAME IS PLAYED ON A RECTANGULAR FIELD WITH GOALS AT EACH END. KEY POSITIONS INCLUDE THE GOALKEEPER, DEFENDERS, MIDFIELDERS, AND FORWARDS. THE GOALKEEPER IS THE ONLY PLAYER ALLOWED TO USE HANDS, BUT ONLY WITHIN THE PENALTY AREA. DEFENDERS PROTECT THEIR GOAL, MIDFIELDERS LINK ATTACK AND DEFENSE, AND FORWARDS FOCUS ON SCORING. PLAYERS MUST FOLLOW RULES SUCH AS NO HANDBALL, OFFSIDE RESTRICTIONS, AND FAIR PLAY. FOULS CAN RESULT IN FREE KICKS OR PENALTIES.

FOOTBALL HAS NUMEROUS PRESTIGIOUS COMPETITIONS. THE FIFA WORLD CUP, HELD EVERY FOUR YEARS, BRINGS TOGETHER NATIONAL TEAMS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. CLUB COMPETITIONS, LIKE THE UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, SHOWCASE THE BEST TEAMS IN EUROPE. DOMESTIC LEAGUES, INCLUDING THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE AND SPAIN’S LA LIGA, ATTRACT HUGE AUDIENCES. LEGENDARY PLAYERS, SUCH AS PELé, DIEGO MARADONA, LIONEL MESSI, AND CRISTIANO RONALDO, HAVE LEFT A LASTING IMPACT ON THE SPORT.

FOOTBALL IS MORE THAN A GAME; IT UNITES PEOPLE, INSPIRES PASSION, AND PROMOTES TEAMWORK AND SPORTSMANSHIP WORLDWIDE.
